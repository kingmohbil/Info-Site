# Informational Site using nodejs

### In this project i'm going to write a javascript code using nodejs to create the server and connect the routes for ex:.

- (`/`) path which refers to the root path will render the index.ejs file.
- (`/contact`) path renders contact-me page.
- (`/about`) path renders about page.
- any path other than those will result in the 404 file being rendered.

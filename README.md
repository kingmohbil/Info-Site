# Informational Site using express and nodejs

### In this project the main goal is that when you navigate to a specific url a specific page is rendered for ex:

- (`/`) path which refers to the root path will render the index.ejs file.
- (`/contact`) path renders contact-me page.
- (`/about`) path renders about page.
- any path other than those will result in the 404 file being rendered.
